		          <p><strong>What is the state of the art of this new technology? </strong></p>
<p>At its core machine learning is artificial intelligence that receives inputs of data and then then through multiple series of simulations and algorithms produces new results of data. The basic premise of machine learning has been around for a long amount of time although there have been recent developments in regards to machine learning software completing more complex functions and applications to larger amounts of data. </p>
                          <strong>What can be done now?</strong>
                          <p>Currently there are many uses of machine learning prevalent within our society. We see machine learning being used to predict friends on Facebook, the results returned from a simple Google search even Amazon Alexa and Google Echo. These all utilise machine learning through data inputs and then through a sequence of algorithms and evolutions to produce an efficient system to be able to predict what a user wants before they know what they want. Netflix uses a similar form of machine learning where it presents different thumbnails to different users based on their watch history. This is in essence the most common use of machine learning that can be seen currently. For example, if a user is consistently watching comedies and if there is a drama starring someone typically known for comedies. Then most likely Netflix will present a thumbnail with the comedian on it as opposed to a co-star who typically works on dramas. This is a machine being given inputs of data then analysing the different factors associated with it and then learning from it to provide a better user experience.</p>
                          <p><strong>What is likely to be able to do be done soon (say in the next 3 years)?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                          <p>Although this is merely scratching the surface of the capabilities of machine learning. The future of machine learning is bright as there are so many different applications of it that could be utilized is countless fields and industries. One of the potential future implementations of machine learning is the continued use of it within search engines and search engine optimisation. By analysing and calculating all of the different search results and queries for an individual user, continued use of machine learning would amplify the accuracy of a user’s search results. This would mean that when searching for something a user would be much more likely to find the solution that they are looking for. Alongside this machine learning could be utilised within marketing and advertising from businesses to consumers. A machine would be presented with a user’s search results and web activity. After this the machine would execute a string of evolutionary algorithms which works to demonstrate the perfect advertising method to a potential consumer. Another likely future possibility of machine learning is the integration of both quantum computing and machine learning. The use of quantum computers would significantly amplify the learning capabilities of a machine. This would increase the speed in, which the machine learning is taking place as well as vastly expand the amount of data that the machine could calculate and analyse at a time. </p>
                          <p><strong>What technological or other developments make this possible?</strong>&nbsp;</p>
                          <p>The primary development that goes hand in hand would be the development of quantum computing. Currently there are great strides being made within both of these fields. The best possible time coming up for both of them will most likely come as a result of the both technologies becoming seamless integrated to optimise a machine’s learning capabilities. Another development is the resolution of an issue currently seen within machine learning. This is the fact that although the programs produce a result from inputted data it still remains largely unknown as to exactly how the computers get from A to B. For a lot of these developments to be made possible there is a greater understanding required for how machines actually learn.</p>

                          <p><strong>What is the potential impact of this development? </strong>&nbsp;</p>
                          <p>Given the development towards quantum computer integration alongside an understanding of the learning process that machines undergo there will be many possible resultant repercussions. One potential impact from both of these would be that society would see more and more uses of machine learning in everyday life. As it becomes more readily available more businesses would likely implement machine learning in their marketing, data crunching and heaps of other applicable fields.</p>
                          <p><strong>What is likely to change? </strong></p>
                          <p>If these developments were proven to be true and successful within the future then there would be a vast change observed within our society. There would likely be medical breakthroughs as machines learn to run simulations at an exponential rate. Advertisers will learn our buying patterns and buying frequencies and with each action we do in the digital space advertisers will learn more strategic and targeted methods to use. Stockbrokers will be able to have computers monitor every exchange made and buy/sell accordingly, essentially making huge changes to the entire market.</p>
                          <p>&nbsp;<strong>Which people will be most affected and how?</strong></p>
                          <p> It’s tough to say who will be affected the most from these developments of machine learning. This is because if industries effectively implement machine learning internally then it’s likely that everyone will be affected in some way. Through machine learning advertisers and stockbrokers will be greatly impacted as they will be able to greatly increase their profits. It is reasonable to say that one of the most affected body of people would be those reliant on the healthcare industry. Machine learning would contribute to significant developments in medicines and would highly likely mean the difference between life and death for some people.</p>
                       <p><strong>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</strong></p>
				<p>There will be some redundancies made in all forms. A lot of non-machine learning technologies will become outdated and inefficient compared to machine learning alternatives. Unfortunately, it will not only be software that will become redundant as some people will lose their jobs to machine learning software. However, a positive to this is that it will also make jobs associated with the creation and maintenance of machine learning based software.</p>

				<p><strong>In your daily life, how will this affect you? </strong></p>
				<p>Throughout my daily life I’m likely to encounter machine learning in one way or another. The most likely way for me to encounter machine learning in my daily life is as a consumer of goods as well as media. Online advertising will be more targeted towards my buying preferences and tendencies that machine learning finds to be prevalent with my purchasing. Not only will I likely encounter this targeted advertising but it is a very real possibility that I will encounter the effects of machine learning with my consumption of both online film as well as social media. Online film primarily being my use of Netflix and the machine learning techniques in which they use to present thumbnails. Alongside thumbnail presentation there is the method in, which Netflix recommends films and shows for me to potentially watch based upon things I have already seen. Social media’s machine learning is similar as it will present posts similar to that which I have already liked as well as the presentation of friends based upon current mutual friends as well as friend’s friends and so on. </p>
                         <p><strong>What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</strong></p>
				<p>The way these systems are all currently working means that it will just develop and progress more so. Although these systems are currently implemented it will be different in the future because the different types of machine learning in my life will progress to becoming more targeted and more accurate to satisfy my new daily needs. The way that continued development in machine learning affects me is considerably similar to the way in, which it affects my friends and family. This is because my friends and family are all consumers of streaming services like Netflix and typical commodities. With them all being typical brand consumers, they would all undergo similar individual advertisement targeting. However, social media’s machine learning will affect my friends as family as, with them getting more connected so do their friends and their friends and so on as social media continues to increase its database of user information.</p>
